Setup:
Run setup.sql on your myssql database to setup the necessary tables
config.inc.php contains the mysql login that you can configure
Run testuser.sql on your myssql database to insert a test user (user: testuser@test.com, password: password). This will be the login for testing. Note that there is no CRUD for the user. It would be similar to the CRUD for the books.
